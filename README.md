# Tictactoe

In this endeavor, I delved into the integration of jQuery within a JavaScript environment, bolstered by the use of HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. The core objective was to develop a Tic Tac Toe game, which I successfully accomplished.
Initially, the project seemed daunting, especially when faced with the professor's provided code. However, as I navigated through the process, I found that the HTML and CSS aspects were fairly intuitive to implement. Overall, the project was engaging; I enjoyed enhancing the content through Bootstrap and CSS, primarily leaning towards CSS to maintain the integrity of the table content.

I opted for Visual Studio Code for the development phase due to its user-friendly interface, subsequently transferring the content to Brackets. A trio of resources - Zybooks, W3Schools, and geekstogeekcode - greatly assisted in project completion. Additionally, previous projects equipped me with the foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap syntaxes and styles.

The allure of these projects lies not only in the end product but also in the educational journey. They serve as robust additions to my portfolio, especially as I scout for internship opportunities. The cumulative knowledge from these endeavors will undeniably play a pivotal role in my final project and future software engineering tasks.
