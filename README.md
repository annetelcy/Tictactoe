# Tictactoe
Project Overview:
In this endeavor, I delved into the integration of jQuery within a JavaScript environment, bolstered by the use of HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. The core objective was to develop a Tic Tac Toe game, which I successfully accomplished.
#Personal Experience:
Initially, the project seemed daunting, especially when faced with the professor's provided code. However, as I navigated through the process, I found that the HTML and CSS aspects were fairly intuitive to implement. Overall, the project was engaging; I enjoyed enhancing the content through Bootstrap and CSS, primarily leaning towards CSS to maintain the integrity of the table content.
#Tools & Resources:
I opted for Visual Studio Code for the development phase due to its user-friendly interface, subsequently transferring the content to Brackets. A trio of resources - Zybooks, W3Schools, and geekstogeekcode - greatly assisted in project completion. Additionally, previous projects equipped me with the foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap syntaxes and styles.
#Conclusion:
The allure of these projects lies not only in the end product but also in the educational journey. They serve as robust additions to my portfolio, especially as I scout for internship opportunities. The cumulative knowledge from these endeavors will undeniably play a pivotal role in my final project and future software engineering tasks.
